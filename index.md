## [Demo Project](https://arnavdev04.github.io/eng10/Demo-Project.html)
In the code where `[Project  ]` is mentioned, just change it to your project name. It will be the hyperlinked text. In this example it is "Demo Project". Do not change the link. Here you will be able to give an introduction of your project. Try to limit it to 4-5 sentences. Do not worry just keep writing, the lines will automatically wrap around.

## [Engineering of the Week](https://arnavdev04.github.io/eng10/EOTW.html)
Engineering of the Week is a dynamic class activity designed to enhance studentsâ€™ understanding and appreciation of the diverse aspects within the field of engineering. Each week, selected students are tasked with presenting a concise yet informative presentation on a topic of their choice related to engineering individually. This can range from highlighting notable engineering achievements, discussing groundbreaking technological advancements, delving into the lives of influential engineers, or exploring significant historical events in the realm of engineering. Through these presentations, students not only broaden their knowledge base, but also develop their research, communication, and presentation skills. Engineering of the Week fosters a collaborative learning environment where students can engage with various engineering topics, sparking curiosity and inspiring future innovations within the field.
