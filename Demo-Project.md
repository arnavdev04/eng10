## The problem:
  * Roommates often forget to complete their assigned chores in time leading to disorganized living spaces.
  * Simple manual methods of tracking can be hard to manage.
  * People can claim to have completed a task without doing it.
  * Ineffective task management can lead to conflicts between roommates.

## Our Solution:
__AN AUTOMATED CHORE TRAKING SYSTEM__

  * The device syncs with the userâ€™s phone to keep track of when chores are completed.
  * The device includes a timer to prevent users cheating the system and make sure they actually do the chores.
  * User-friendly interface for easy implementation of task management system.
  * Sensor detects when a cleaning implement has been picked up.
